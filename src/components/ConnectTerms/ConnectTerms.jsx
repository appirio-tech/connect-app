            <li><strong>Services and Deliverables.</strong> The Services may be purchased either on Topcoder Connect or pursuant to an Order Form entered into by you and Topcoder referencing this Agreement (an &ldquo;<strong>Order Form</strong>&rdquo;). Topcoder agrees to provide the Services ordered on Topcoder Connect or described in an Order Form (the "<strong>Deliverables</strong>"). &nbsp;&nbsp;All Services and Deliverables are created by launching Challenges (as defined below) using Topcoder's crowdsourcing platform, available at the topcoder.com website and online and mobile tools for engaging the Topcoder community through crowdsourced competitions (the &ldquo;<strong>Platform</strong>&rdquo;).

For all other types of Challenges (other than design Challenges), the Winning Submission shall be the submission with the highest score based on Topcoder&rsquo;s standard community review and scoring processes. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties pursuant to this Section 4.2, User acknowledges and agrees that it will obtain rights solely in and to the Winning Submission, as further described in Section 7.2, and no other Challenge submissions.

Under no circumstances shall the Platform, tools or documentation be deemed to be included in the Custom Software.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Software</strong>. If the Specifications (as mutually agreed by the parties) provide for the Custom Software to interface with, accompany, or include software or material not developed by Topcoder or its affiliates, including any open source software ("<strong>Third-Party Software</strong>"), any such Third-Party Software shall be subject to its own terms and conditions, and shall not be considered part of the Custom Software or the Licensed Software under this Agreement. Third-Party Software shall accompany or be included in Custom Software only with User's permission. User shall bear all license fees and other expenses, if any, applicable to such Third-Party Software.</li>
            <li><strong>Export Compliance</strong>. Regardless of whether User is a U.S.-based entity, User shall not export or re-export any of the Custom Software, Third-Party Software or Licensed Software (in whole or in part) to any country without ensuring that such export complies with the Export Administration Regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and any other applicable statute, regulation, or government order.

"<strong>Confidential Information</strong>" means information which provided by either party under this Agreement (in such capacity, the "<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>") to the other party (in such capacity, the "<strong>Receiving Party</strong>") which is proprietary, trade secret and/or confidential, including, but not limited to, techniques, designs, specifications, drawings, blueprints, tracings, diagrams, models, samples, flow charts, data, computer programs, disks, diskettes, tapes, business plans, marketing plans, User names and other technical, financial or commercial information and intellectual property. For the avoidance of doubt, the Platform, tools and associated documentation or materials, and any other information that Topcoder provides to User hereunder that should reasonably be known to be confidential, shall constitute Topcoder's Confidential Information. Expect as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information.</li>
            <li><strong>Exceptions</strong>. These confidentiality obligations shall not apply to any Confidential Information which: (a) is generally known to the public at the time of disclosure or later becomes so generally known (including Confidential Information which is disclosed as part of a Challenge); and (b) is required by law, court order or a governmental agency to be disclosed</li>
            <li><strong>Title and License to User's Confidential Information</strong>.

            <li><strong>Equitable Relief</strong>. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone may not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</li>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality on the Platform. </strong>User acknowledges and agrees that members of the Topcoder Community are not bound by the confidentiality obligations under this Section 8 and User acknowledges that any Specifications, information contained in an Order Form or other information that the Topcoder Community is provided in connection with the Services (except for personally identifiable information or payment information) is not Confidential Information.</li>
