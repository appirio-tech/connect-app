      <h1>Terms</h1>
      <p>This User Agreement (the "<strong>Agreement</strong>") is a contract between you (referred to herein as "<strong>User</strong>") and Topcoder Inc. ("Topcoder") and applies to User's use and viewing of <a href="http://connect.topcoder.com">connect.topcoder.com</a> and related sub-domains ("<strong>Topcoder Connect</strong>") and all services available through Topcoder Connect (the "<strong>Services</strong>"). By visiting Topcoder Connect, User has accepted this Agreement and has agreed to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Any Custom Software ordered (as defined below) or Services used through Topcoder Connect are also governed by these Terms. Topcoder may amend this Agreement at any time by posting a revised version on Topcoder Connect. The revised version will be effective at the time Topcoder posts it.</p>
      <h2>1. Services and Specifications.</h2>
      <p>The Services provide for the creation of certain types of mock-ups, prototypes, and application development of computer software applications (the "<b>Deliverables</b>") through Topcoder's crowdsourcing platform (as defined below) through a Topcoder representative or co-pilot (referred to herein as a "<b>User Success Manager</b>"), as further described on Topcoder Connect. To utilize the Services, User has provided specifications with respect to the Deliverables in reasonable detail as prompted in several fields on webpages associated with Topcoder Connect where the User was requested to enter information regarding the intended Deliverable (such information, the "<b>Preliminary Specifications</b>"). After payment of Project Fees (as defined below) associated with the Deliverable, a User Success Manager shall contact User to gather additional information regarding the Deliverables, as may be necessary in Topcoder's sole discretion. Topcoder and User shall mutually agree on a final set of specifications, which shall be referred to herein as the "<b>Specifications</b>". To the extent the parties are not able to reach agreement on the Specifications, including, but not limited to situations where the information provided by User is insufficient to create Specifications or the Preliminary Specifications are outside the scope of the services described on Topcoder Connect, Topcoder shall refund to User any Project Fees paid by User and Topcoder shall have no further liability or obligations under this Agreement.</p>
      <h2>2. Definitions.</h2>
      <p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following capitalized terms have the meanings assigned to them in this Section 2. Any capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not otherwise defined in this Section shall have the meanings assigned to them elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Project Fees</strong>: The fees associated with the Services and the creation of the Deliverables as specified on Topcoder Connect (or as may be further mutually agreed between the parties).</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge</strong>: An online innovation competition run exclusively on the Platform (as defined below) utilizing the topcoder Community. Challenges may also be referred to as "Competitions" or "Contests."</li>
        <li><strong>Effective Date</strong>: The Effective Date is the date that User registers to use Topcoder Connect and pays Project Fees associated therewith.</li>

      </ul>
      <h2>3. The Platform.</h2>
      <p>No Right to Directly Access Platform. Using Topcoder Connect allows User to utilize the topcoder Community indirectly through the User Success Manager only. To the extent User desires to access the topcoder Platform and/or launch Challenges directly, User must enter into a separate agreement with Topcoder to purchase challenges and/or a subscription for such services. See <a href="http://topcoder.com/pricing">topcoder.com/pricing</a> for more details about subscription pricing and fees associated with Challenges when utilized with a subscription.</p>
      <h3>Title.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Title to the Platform</strong>. Topcoder retains all right, title and interest in and to the Platform, tools and associated documentation or materials. Any use of the Platform, tools or associated documentation or materials beyond the scope of the rights expressly granted in this Agreement is prohibited and shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, pursuant to which Topcoder may immediately terminate this Agreement and any work-in-progress. User shall retain Topcoder's copyright notices and authorship credits in the Platform, tools and associated documentation or materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Submissions</strong>. Challenge submissions may be provided to, or otherwise made available to, User for User review and selection of a winning Challenge submission. User shall select one (1) winning Challenge submission (the "Winning Submission") and shall notify the User Success Manager promptly of such Winning Submission. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties pursuant to this Section 3.b.ii, User acknowledges and agrees that it will obtain rights solely in and to the Winning Submission, as further described in Section 6b, and no other Challenge submissions. The rights in and to any Challenge submissions other than the Winning Submission shall be retained by the member of the topcoder Community who submitted such Challenge submission and, for the purposes of this Agreement, such Challenge submissions shall be deemed to be Topcoder Confidential Information. Upon mutual agreement of the parties, User may purchase more than one (1) Challenge submission and Topcoder shall invoice User for such additional payment necessary to purchase such additional Challenge submission(s), and upon Topcoder's receipt of such payment, such purchased additional Challenge submission(s) shall also be deemed to be Winning Submissions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>4. Payment.</h2>
      <p>User is responsible for the timely payment of all Project Fees and for providing Topcoder with a valid payment method for all Project Fees. The parties understand and acknowledge that Topcoder is under no obligation to provide any Services or deliver any Deliverables until the Project Fees are paid in full, using the payment method Topcoder determines to be acceptable as described on Topcoder Connect and/or any invoices issued in relation thereto. User agrees that Topcoder may charge the payment method provided by User for all Project Fees and User represents and warrants that User has the legal right to use any credit cards or other payment means used to initiate any transaction.  User agrees to pay all charges incurred by User at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. User will also be responsible for paying any applicable taxes relating to User's purchases. Except as explicitly set forth in Section 1 or Section 9a, all Project Fees are final and non-refundable.</p>
      <h2>5. Term and Termination.</h2>
      <p>This Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and will continue unless terminated as set forth in this Agreement ("Term"). Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against such party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). Section 4 (Payment), Section 5 (Term and Termination), Section 7 (Confidential Information), Section 8 (Limitation of Liability), and Section 12 (General) of this Agreement shall survive any termination or expiration hereof.</p>
      <h2>6. Crowdsourcing Challenges and Software.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Challenges</strong>. Topcoder will conduct Challenges for User on the Platform among members of the topcoder Community using the Platform tools to provide the Services. Topcoder shall have final control over all Challenge documents (e.g., specifications, contest rules and requirements, prizes, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Software</strong>. Subject to payment in full of all Project Fees, Topcoder does hereby assign and agrees to assign to User all right, title and interest to work product, other than Licensed Software and Third-Party Software (each, as defined below), resultant of the Winning Submission (the "Custom Software"). Under no circumstances shall the Platform, tools or documentation be deemed to be included in the Custom Software.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Software</strong>. If the Specifications (as mutually agreed by the parties) provide for the Custom Software to interface with, accompany, or include software or material not developed by Topcoder or its affiliates, including any open source software ("Third-Party Software"), any such Third-Party Software shall be subject to its own terms and conditions, and shall not be considered part of the Custom Software or the Licensed Software under this Agreement. Third-Party Software shall accompany or be included in Custom Software only with User's permission. User shall bear all license fees and other expenses, if any, applicable to such Third-Party Software.</li>
        <li><strong>Licensed Software</strong>. If the Specifications (as mutually agreed by the parties) provide for the use of software components from the topcoder catalog described at <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/download/misc/Catalog_Software_License.pdf">http://www.topcoder.com/download/misc/Catalog_Software_License.pdf</a> (to accelerate development of User's software programs) (such as the "Licensed Software" and the license referenced in the aforementioned web-page, the "topcoder Software Component License"), any such Licensed Software incorporated into the Custom Software is licensed to User subject to the topcoder Software Component License.</li>
        <li><strong>Export Compliance</strong>. Regardless of whether User is a U.S.-based entity, User shall not export or re-export any of the Custom Software, Third-Party Software or Licensed Software (in whole or in part) to any country without ensuring that such export complies with the Export Administration Regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and any other applicable statute, regulation, or government order. User warrants that it is not named on any U.S. government denied-party list.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>7. Confidential Information.</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Confidential Information</strong>. "Confidential Information" means information which provided by either party under this Agreement (in such capacity, the "Disclosing Party") to the other party (in such capacity, the "Receiving Party") which is proprietary, trade secret and/or confidential, including, but not limited to, techniques, designs, specifications, drawings, blueprints, tracings, diagrams, models, samples, flow charts, data, computer programs, disks, diskettes, tapes, business plans, marketing plans, User names and other technical, financial or commercial information and intellectual property. For the avoidance of doubt, the Platform, tools and associated documentation or materials, and any other information that Topcoder provides to User hereunder that should reasonably be known to be confidential, shall constitute Topcoder's Confidential Information. Expect as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information.</li>
        <li><strong>Exceptions</strong>. These confidentiality obligations shall not apply to any Confidential Information which: (a) is generally known to the public at the time of disclosure or later becomes so generally known (including Confidential Information which is disclosed as part of a Challenge); and (b) is required by law, court order or a governmental agency to be disclosed</li>
        <li><strong>Title and License to User's Confidential Information</strong>. All right, title, and ownership to Confidential Information provided by User hereunder, including the Preliminary Specifications, remains with User. User represents that it has all rights in the Confidential Information necessary to include it in a Challenge. User hereby grants to Topcoder a license to use such Confidential Information provided by User solely for the purposes of providing the Services, including conducting the applicable Challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Equitable Relief</strong>. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone may not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability.</h2>
      <p>NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, OR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL TOPCODER'S LIABILITY TO USER EXCEED THE PROJECT FEES PAID BY USER TO TOPCODER. THE EXISTENCE OF ONE OR MORE CLAIMS WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 8 WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE</p>
      <h2>9. Warranty.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Limited Warranty</strong>. For a period of ten (10) days from the provision of the Challenge submissions to the User, Topcoder warrants that the Custom Software will materially conform to the Specifications. If the Custom Software does not materially conform to the Specifications, User shall, within ten (10) days from the provision of the Challenge submissions to the Customer, notify Topcoder in writing of and adequately describe any such non-conformance, and User's exclusive remedy and Topcoder's sole obligation shall be to, at Topcoder' sole discretion, either (1) investigate the errors and use commercially reasonable efforts to bring the Custom Software into material conformance with the Specifications; or (2) refund or credit the Project Fees paid for that Custom Software. The warranty set forth in this section does not apply to Custom Software that have been modified, damaged or operated contrary to the Specifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Disclaimer</strong>. THE FOREGOING WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AND ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING TOPCODER CONNECT, THE SERVICES AND THE DELIVERABLES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. TOPCODER MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTY OF ANY KIND TO USER OR TO ANY OTHER PARTY. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Project Fees charged by Topcoder under this Agreement reflect the allocation of risks provided by the foregoing warranty, the limitations of liability, and other terms set forth in this Agreement, and any modification of the allocation of risks would affect the Project Fees charged.</li>
